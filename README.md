# Facial-Expression-Detector
Used deep learning for building the models. InceptionNet architecture was used to build one of the models. The InceptionNet architecture yielded an accuracy of 53% and the other model yielded an accuracy of 68%. As of now, only FERC2013 dataset has been used for training, validation, and testing.


# How to:
1. Download the FER-2013 dataset. 
2. Put all the files in the same folder.
3. Run data_preprocessing.py
4. Run the training file of the model required.
5. Run classification.py
